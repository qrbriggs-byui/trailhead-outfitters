/*
  Vite Configuration
  ------------------
  This project has more than one HTML page:
  - index.html is the home page.
  - design-documents.html is linked from the footer.

  By listing both files here, Vite includes both pages when we run:
  npm run build

  That also means npm run preview can show the design document link.
